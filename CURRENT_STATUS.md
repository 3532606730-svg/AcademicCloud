# AcademicCloud Current Status

**Last updated:** 2026-08-12

## Current Layer

**Layer 1 — Basic Private Cloud Storage: In Progress**

`L1-E01 — Core Architecture Scaffold` is complete. No database, authentication, storage, or file-management implementation has started.

## Current Objective

`L1-E01 — Core Architecture Scaffold` is complete. `L1-E02 — Database Foundation` is Ready and awaits the next explicit task-selection instruction.

- [x] Completed `SETUP-004 — Autonomous AcademicCloud Engineering Workflow`
- [x] Completed Layer 0 — Project Setup
- [x] Created npm workspaces with one lockfile for `backend/` and `frontend/`
- [x] Fixed the Layer 1 development runtime at Node.js `24.16.0` and npm `11.13.0`
- [x] Added the Fastify platform bootstrap, validated environment configuration, structured logging, and `GET /api/health`
- [x] Added the React/Vite SPA bootstrap and same-origin `/api` development proxy
- [x] Added backend health/configuration tests and repository type-check/build workflows
- [x] Verified direct API access, Vite-proxied API access, and the frontend development page
- [x] Completed `L1-E01 — Core Architecture Scaffold`

## Current Task

`L1-E01 — Core Architecture Scaffold` is **Done**.

## Approved Layer 1 Technical Baseline

- Backend: Node.js 24 LTS, TypeScript, and Fastify 5.
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, and Vite SPA.
- Database: SQLite with `better-sqlite3` behind the persistence/repository boundary.
- Authentication: SQLite-backed server-side opaque sessions.
- Password hashing: a maintained memory-hard implementation, with Argon2id preferred; package and parameters are deferred to the Authentication task.
- Package management: npm workspaces with one `package-lock.json`.
- Production: Nginx, systemd, and one Node.js process; no Docker, Redis, queue, or permanent worker.
- Storage: `StorageAdapter` with `AliyunOssStorageAdapter`; private OSS bucket; short-lived browser-direct upload authorization and signed downloads.
- Module boundaries: `platform`, `auth`, `drive`, `storage`, and `persistence`.
- Node version policy: use Node.js 24 LTS and select the latest supported 24.x security patch at dependency-installation or deployment time.

## Confirmed Environment Facts

- Local operating system: Windows 11 x64.
- Node.js `v24.16.0` is available.
- `npm.cmd` and `npx.cmd` are available.
- No standard Python development environment is currently available; the discovered LibreOffice-embedded Python is not the project runtime.
- Docker, WSL, PostgreSQL, Redis, and similar infrastructure are not currently required dependencies.
- The C: drive has approximately 9.6 GiB free; dependency and cache size should remain controlled.
- GitHub HTTPS currently has a certificate-trust error. Record this as an environment risk for later handling; do not change VPN, certificates, or network configuration without approval.
- The target Ubuntu server has 512 MB RAM, so Layer 1 architecture and deployment must remain lightweight.

## Not Started

- [x] core application scaffold
- [ ] database implementation
- [ ] authentication
- [ ] storage integration
- [ ] file management
- [ ] frontend functionality
- [ ] deployment

## Current Constraints

- Do not start `L1-E02` without a user instruction selecting the Ready task.
- Keep work within the approved task, Layer 1 scope, and accepted architecture.
- Escalate only the mandatory boundaries defined by `.agents/skills/academiccloud-workflow/SKILL.md`.
- No OCR/RAG/connectors.
- No architecture expansion without approval.

## Next Milestone

`L1-E02 — Database Foundation` is **Ready — starts on a user task-selection instruction such as `开始下一个任务`**. It will define the SQLite persistence boundary, versioned migrations, account/user representation, folder and file metadata models, and integrity constraints. It has not started.
